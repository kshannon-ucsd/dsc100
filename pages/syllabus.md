- **Final exam date**: No in class final exam, this exam will be done remote.
- Your letter grade will be determined using the [standard grading scale](https://pages.stolaf.edu/dietz/typical-grading-scale/). Grades are not rounded up, that’s why we have included bonus points.

### Grades
Grades are released often a week after the submission date, typically sooner. Ultimately it is your responsibility to check your final grade and get in touch if you believe there is a problem.

### Regrade Policy
The regrade policy is here to protect students from serious issues in grading, not to provide students with a platform to argue about, or plead for an extra point. A grader may incorrectly take off 1-2 points, but they are as likely to give students 1-2 points. In our experience less than 3% of the time a regrade results in a change. When we regrade, we closely go through the entire assignment again and reevaluate it as a whole. This means your grade can either stay the same, go up, or go down. This is not to discourage students from requesting legitimate regrades, but to discourage students from arguing about 1 point (which is worth 0.05% of your grade). These discussions require a serious investment of time. We want to spend that time on regrades where a serious issue has occurred, or with helping students learn the material outside of class.

**If you think a grading error has occurred please follow these steps:**
- You have 72 hours to request a regrade
- Initiate the regrade through Gradescope (if it is a group project, confer w/ your team first and submit one regrade after your team comes to a consensus)
- Provide evidence for why your answer is correct and merits a regrade (i.e. a specific reference to something said in a lecture, the readings, or office hours)
- We will get back to you within 48 hours with our final decision.

### Lecture Attendance
Our goal is to make lectures and office hours worth your while to attend, e.g. we do in-class exercises. However, lecture attendance is not required. We will make every effort to record lectures, but things happen. These will be made available to you (UCSD podcast). Quizzes will also occur during class, so you will need to attend those classes.

### Section Attendance
Section attendance is not mandatory. Demos as well as lecture material will be reviewed in the section and it is to your benefit to go and ask questions.

## Course Homeworks & Topics
This journey is designed to immerse you in the foundational aspects of database systems, a cornerstone in the world of data science. Databases are the backbone of countless applications and play a pivotal role in storing, organizing, and retrieving data efficiently. Through this course, you'll delve into the core principles of database management, understand its significance in data-driven decision-making, and develop skills essential for any budding data professional. You will alsop learn the ins and outs of writing good effecient SQL code. Homeworks will cause you to dive deeper and immerse yourselves in the material.

### Homeworks
Homeworks will be some of the more difficult parts of this class. That is by design, because I firmly believe in students being given time to wrestle with tough problems. The exams and quizzes should be  easier and will reflect material that you should be familair with and know.

- Three individual assignments submitted through Gradescope
- Use the Google Doc template link (found on this website under assignments), **make a copy of the template**. You do not have edit access to the version that is linked, only the ability to copy it.
- One PDF submission per student (ensure your name and PID are on the PDF)
- You may resubmit as many times as you like before the deadline
- Late assignments have 5 points deducted within the first 24 hours, and an additional 5 points during the following 24 hours.
- No late assignments accepted after 48 hours

There will be 5 homeworks consisting of written problem-solving and programming assignments. The purpose of the homeworks is to provide students with the opportunity to apply and practice the concepts and skills learned in the lectures. Homeworks will be rigorous and require students to demonstrate a deeper understanding of the material. A list of HWs can be found on this webpage in the side menu under **Homework**


Due dates: These can be found on the course calendar (this web site's home page). Instructions for submitted HW will be found in that area as well. Late HW is penalized by a 20% grade reduction, each day it is late. 

Late Day Policy: You have up to 3 late days to use on homework assignments. These late days can be used in 24-hour chunks. You can only use one late day on each assignment. Late days are meant to be a safety net and should not be used as a convenience. It is expected that you will not need to use your late days and that you will submit all assignments on time. If you use all of your late days, it is likely that you are not managing your time effectively and will need to adjust your study habits. Please note that no excuses for not submitting assignments on time will be accepted once you have exhausted your late days. There is no need to inform us you will be using them. When we calculate your grade we will see how many late submissions you have and handle it then on your behalf. 

Note: Homework assignments can be completed in teams of size 2. This means that you can work with one other student to complete the assignment and submit a single solution. It is expected that each member of the team will contribute equally to the solution and have a thorough understanding of the material. Collaboration is encouraged as it can help deepen understanding and facilitate learning, but it is important that all team members understand the work being submitted and are able to explain it if necessary. Plagiarism and cheating will not be tolerated and will result in disciplinary action.

### Quizzes
These will be short 4-8 question quizzes held in class to ensure material is sticking and provide more opportunities to interact with the material. These should be easy if you are keeping up with your studying and are not intended to punish you. they are only worth 10% of your grade when combined and we drop the lowest. Quizzes are just our way to make sure you keep up with studying and do not fall too far behind. As this class really builds on each previous week.


### Exam
The midterm exam will cover all topics up until Formal Query Languages. It will be held remote. There will be a review session with your TA/IAs.

The final exam will be comprehensive and will be held remote.

No late exams are permitted, except for extenuating circumstances. Please reach out to staff as early as possible if you know something will prevent you from taking the exam on time. The later you wait... the less likely we are to accept your request.

Note that there is no makeups for the midterm or final, except in extreme circumstances. If you know there uis a chanceyou will miss it, talk to me and your TA. Rememebr it is remote so you will be able towork on it from anywhere. In the event there is an emergency and you must miss it without informing us, that is ok. We understand life happens and some emergencies are out of your control. We will habdle these on a case-by-case basis. Be sure to reach out to us ASAP.




## Other Good Stuff

### Teamwork Expectations
Your team will be working on the final together. We expect all students to, more or less, be equal contributors to the final project. No one person should be doing a project, they are meant to be collaborative and give you experience working with people you probably do not know. One successful approach is to first agree on a communication tool/protocol and a schedule. Next, discuss each person’s strengths and divide up responsibilities. Develop a schedule for completing tasks, who is responsible, and a backup person in case an emergency occurs. Finally, check in regularly to ensure progress is being made and leave some time to check and proofread each other's work. Especially because some students in your group may be remote for part of the class.

**Dealing with non-cooperative team members** -- If an issue occurs first try to work the issue out within your group. Save all documentation, emails, and chats as a record in case you need to contact the course staff. We will step in and try to communicate with the student(s) to resolve this. If no resolution can be made, or the problem resurfaces, we reserve the right to move the student to a new group or grade that student separately from the group, or any other action to resolve the issue.

**Group work is never easy** -- Teamwork, while difficult (especially during potentially remote interaction), is one of the most important skills you should learn and practice during college. To succeed, communication is critical. You need to be in contact with your group regularly. This will help you keep on top of deliverables and make adjustments if problems should arise. We are always here to help and make use of our experience working on real engineering/science projects.

### Class/Web Conduct
In all interactions in this class, you are expected to be respectful. This includes following the UC San Diego [principles of the community](https://ucsd.edu/about/principles.html).

This class will be a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), political beliefs/leanings, or technology choices.

At all times, you should be considerate and respectful. Always refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Last of all, take care of each other.

If you have a concern, please speak with Kyle or your TAs. If you are uncomfortable doing so, that’s ok! The [OPHD](https://blink.ucsd.edu/HR/policies/sexual/OPHD.html) (Office for the Prevention of Sexual Harassment and Discrimination) and [CARE](https://care.ucsd.edu/) (confidential advocacy and education office for sexual violence and gender-based violence) are wonderful resources on campus.


### Academic Integrity
Don't cheat.

You are encouraged to (and at times will have to) work together and help one another. However, you are personally responsible for the work you submit (quizzes/exams). For assignments, it is also your responsibility to ensure you understand everything your group has submitted and to make sure the correct file has been uploaded, that the upload is uncorrupted and that it renders correctly. Projects may include ideas and code from other sources—but these other sources must be documented with clear attribution. Please review academic integrity policies [here](http://academicintegrity.ucsd.edu).

We anticipate you all doing well in this course; however, if you are feeling lost or overwhelmed, that’s ok! Should that occur, we recommend: (i.) asking questions in/after class, (ii.) attending office hours, and/or (iii.) reaching out to course staff.

Cheating and plagiarism have been and will be strongly penalized. If, for whatever reason, this website, or Gradescope is down, or something else prohibits you from being able to turn in an assignment on time, immediately contact course staff via email (attach your assignment/quiz/exam answers) or else it will be graded as late.

### Disability​ ​Access
Students requesting accommodations due to a disability must provide a current Authorization for Accommodation (AFA) letter. These letters are issued by the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD), which is located in University Center 202 behind Center Hall. To arrange accommodations please contact Kyle [kshannon@ucsd.edu](kshannon@ucsd.edu) privately, I will loop in the appropriate course staff to act as a liaison.

Contacting the OSD can help you further:

### Questions & Feedback
**How to Get Your Question(s) Answered and/or Provide Feedback**
It’s great that we have many ways to communicate, but it can get tricky to figure out who to contact or where your question belongs, or when to expect a response. These guidelines are to help you get your question answered as quickly as possible and to ensure that we’re able to get to everyone’s questions.

That said, to ensure that we’re respecting their time, TAs and IAs have been instructed they’re only obligated to answer questions between normal working hours (M-F 9am-5pm). However, I know that’s not when you may be doing your work. So, please feel free to reach out whenever is best for you while knowing that, you may not get a response until the next day. As such, do your best not to wait until the last minute to ask a question. If there is an emergency and you need to contact staff immediately, email Kyle and put "EMERGENCY-COGS9" in the subject line. I will get back to you ASAP.

If you have…
- **questions about course content** - these are awesome! We want everyone to see them and have their questions answered, please post questions, or ask during class/office hours.
- **questions about course logistics** - first, check the syllabus. If the answer is not there, ask in Section, ask a classmate, or ask during class/office hours.
- **something super cool to share related to class** - feel free to email Kyle [kshannon@ucsd.edu](kshannon@ucsd.edu)) or come to office hours. Be sure to include COGS9 in the email subject line and your full name in your message.
- **something you want to talk about in-depth** - meet in person/digitally during office hours or schedule a time to meet 1:1 by email. Be sure to include COGS9 in the email subject line. Or it may be missed. [kshannon@ucsd.edu](kshannon@ucsd.edu).
