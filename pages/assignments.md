# Assignments


## Guide for Submitting Assignments

In this class, you'll be tasked with various assignments (HWs, quizzes and exams) that span both coding and non-coding disciplines. We've designed the submission process to be as straightforward as possible from a student and administrative perspective. (Although, we can't promise the assignments themselves will all be easy! ðŸ˜‰)

**Submission Platform**: All assignments should be submitted through **Gradescope**.

#### Column Definitions:
1. **Code (.json)**: Submit in to Gradescope. We will provide you with a `.json` file for each assignment.
2. **Multiple Choice**: Assignments may have a multiple-choice section, completed on Gradescope.
3. **Free Response (.pdf)**: Submit a `.pdf` file of your written response to Gradescope for manual grading.
4. **Team Collaboration**: Indicates if collaboration with fellow students is permitted for the assignment.

### Formatting Scripts for Autograding

Our autograding system is both robust and flexible, ensuring no dependency on changing external systems and minimizing vendor lock concerns:

1. Download the homework `.json` file we provide for each assignment.
2. Add your answers to this `.json` file, adhering to any specific instructions given.
3. Submit your file (e.g., `hw1.json`) to Gradescope.
4. Our system uses a Docker image to process the file.
5. Gradescope will run your file using our Docker image and produce a grade.
6. Every `.json` file will contain a test question and answer. *Do not modify these*. They're designed to always be marked as correct, ensuring the autograder functions even if all other answers are wrong.
7. You can resubmit your file as many times as you like before the due date, except for the midterm and final exams.

We'll provide more detailed instructions on assignments, as well as formatting, and template `.json` files below!
