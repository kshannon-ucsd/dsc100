# Getting Started

1. Join the class Piazza: **{{ variables.piazza_link }}** 
   - Access code: **{{ variables.piazza_access_code }}** 
   - Use Piazza to ask questions and get help from your fellow students, TAs, IAs, and myself
2. You should have been auto enrolled into Gradescope (via Canvas) ifyou are enrolled in DSC 100. 
3. There is a class Canvas, I use it omly to integrate Gradescope with all of your PIDs and info and to submit final grades.
   - You will never use Canvas in this class, nor access it. So do not worry about Canvas.
4. Go through week one lecture (podcasted if you missed it), work through the demo, get ready for quiz 1. Check Gradescope for release date.
5. Get ready to have a good time!
