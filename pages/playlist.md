# ðŸŽµ Playlists

Welcome to the ultimate code-cranking playlists! Feel free to study, debug, or just groove along. Every track has been carefully SELECTed, WHERE beats_per_minute > 100, and INSERTed into this musical database just for you. Rest assured, all music is fully SQL-approved and meticulously optimized by our in-house team of audiophile devs. So put on your headphones, hit play, and let these rhythms help you JOIN forces with productivity. Remember, in our playlists, there are no NULL beatsâ€”only sound statements!
