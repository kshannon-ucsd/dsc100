# ðŸ“† Calendar

Lectures and discussions are all held in Warren Lecture Hall (WLH) 2114 
- Check the calendar for the most up todate locations and times of OHs. We will also make announcements, but this calendar is the source of truth.
- Week 1, Thursday is July 4th and a federal holiday. There will be no class or OHs that day.

Most office hours are held in person in the HalÄ±cÄ±oÄŸlu Data Science Institute. Office hours held remotely will have zoom links added to the OH location on this calendar.
